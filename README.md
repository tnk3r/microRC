# microRC
#mini Red Camera Controller written in python for basic controls.

# Tkinter was used for beginning developers to start with un-modified linux/mac python environment
# I created this software during a prep week to control a 360 degree Camera array over wireless with low bandwidth connectivity.

# Get Camera status is not implemented. It increases traffic on the triangulated radios and increases pps dramatically. Therefore it was not implemented.
# It would need an additional thread and parser to get status, this is not included in this script. I dont recommend adding it to this utility.

Supported Features:

-Supports TCP/IP Connection only..
-FrameRate
-ShutterSpeed
-WhiteBalance
-ISO
-RecordFunction
-Project FPS, Redcode
-Also, F-Stop on Supported Still Lenses.
