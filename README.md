# microRC
mini Red Camera Controller written in python for basic controls.

Tkinter was used for beginning developers to start with un-modified linux/mac python environment
I created this software 2 years ago during a prep week to control a 360 degree Camera array over wireless with low bandwidth connectivity. I finally decided to share it with the world. 

Get Camera status is not implemented. It increases traffic on the triangulated radios and increases pps dramatically. Therefore it was not implemented.
It would need an additional thread and parser to get status, this is not included in this script. I dont recommend adding it to this utility.

Supported Features:

-Supports TCP/IP Connection only..

  -FrameRate

  -ShutterSpeed

  -WhiteBalance

  -ISO

  -RecordFunction

  -Project FPS, Redcode

  -F-Stop on Supported Still Lenses.
